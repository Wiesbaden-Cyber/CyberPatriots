# CyberPatriots Prepartions, Training, and Experience

## Purpose

The Wiesbaden Cyber Program needs an established way for preparing and training new and old students for the CyberPatriots competition. In addition, a centralized place for students to store their step-by-step solutions and checklists is needed. This repository aims to address these.
